todo:
- [x] add label at bottom of card to optionally describe the rxn
- [x] normal sans serif font in reagent lines
- [ ] allow images in reagents
- [x] allow for wildcards -- so one card format can make many others if it has one component which is different or something
- [ ] different card formats, etc.
- [ ] keep all images at the same resolution on a card such that all the atoms look like they're the same size
- [ ] triple bonds in quotes need to work -- also really need to get that scaling to work
